##Using $http  in an angular service

To try this out:
* Clone this repo
* cd into it
* python -m SimpleHTTPServer (starts a web server on port 8000)
* browse to http://localhost:8000
* Play

This is a repeat of https://github.com/stevecass/ang-4-data-service but uses the "controller as" syntax in place of $scope.
